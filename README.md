# TODO-application
A simple TODO web app made by using React js library used to handle TODOs on priority basis.

#### Note: These files are the source code of this app.
#### Direction for use: 
1> download node js along with react js library of version 1.5.2
2> create a react app (this will be a single step process, everything will be done by npm itself)
3> move on to the directory of newly created react app
4> replace the "src" directory of that app with the "src" directory of TODO-application that you have downloaded from here.
5> push a command on your system terminal "npm start" and enjoy
